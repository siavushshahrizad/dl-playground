# dl-playground 🧠

Welcome to **DL Playground**! This repository is a collection of small, hands-on projects designed to help me learn and experiment with **Deep Learning** concepts.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here:
- Neural network projects for image classification (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10).
- Experiments with feedforward neural networks and transformers
- Exploration of frameworks like PyTorch

## 🚀 Goals:
- Build an intuitive understanding of neural networks.
- Experiment with training, testing, and evaluating deep learning models.
- Play around with different architectures and optimization techniques.

## 📂 Project Structure:
- `digit_classification/`: Classify handwritten digits using neural networks.

## 🤝 Contributions:
Feel free to fork, experiment, and submit pull requests to improve or expand the projects!
